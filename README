JS Quickcheck
=============

This is a fork from Darrin Thompsons Quickcheck for JavaScript (http://bitbucket.org/darrint/qc.js/)
plus some modifications:

- changed directory structure
- added support for rhino by adding RhinoListener
- created abstract class "ConsoleListener" the FireBug and Rhino reporting
  classes inherit its functionality from
- changed "Arbitrary" generators to be objects with
  fields arb and shrink (to add shrinking support later).
  "Arbitrary" generator functions as in Darrins Quickcheck are still allowed.
- added genvalue to create next value from generator
  (so functions or objects with field "arb" are supported)
- added generator frequency taking a list of generators and select one 
  depending on relative frequency
- renamed arbList to arbArray
- added arbSelect to uniformly select one of the given generators
- added arbNull which will always return 'null'
- added arbNullOr generator returning null or the given generators 
  return value (probability for null is 0.1)
- implemented 'classify' and 'collect' (see selfcheck.js for example)
- added runrhino.js to tests so one can run selfcheck from command line
  by 'rhino runrhino.js'
- added toString() methods to Pass, Fail and Counts for error reporting
- added support for shrinking (completely untested as of yet)

TODO:
=====
- start some kind of documentation
- add jsdoc toolkit markup for API documentation
