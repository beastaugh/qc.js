JS Quickcheck Features
======================

- Listener UI's for Firebug, Firebug Lite (cross browser), and Rhino 
- Arbitrary generators are objects with fields arb and shrink (to add
  shrinking support later).
- Nice stable of generators available out of the box.
- arbArray to generate an arbitrary JS array.
- arbSelect to uniformly select one of the given generators
- arbNull which will always return 'null'
- arbNullOr generator returning null or the given generators return
  value (probability for null is 0.1)
- implemented 'classify' and 'collect' (see selfcheck.js for example)
- added runrhino.js to tests so one can run selfcheck from command line
  by 'rhino runrhino.js'
- added toString() methods to Pass, Fail and Counts for error reporting
- added support for shrinking (mostly untested as of yet)
- added shrinking functions to generators

TODO:
=====
- start some kind of documentation
- add jsdoc toolkit markup for API documentation

qc.js was originally written by Darrin Thompson with extensive contributions
from Steffen Seiring.
